> Sort and Uniq utils
> Unix-like systems usually have useful small programs sort and uniq. First of them reads text lines from file (or console) and outputs them in sorted order. The second allows to filter out unique or non-unique lines from the file. Implement both of these utilities in your favorite language. Compare the performance with the original programs.

> Advanced level - you'll need to create some random text generating tool to create larger input files. You also need to have a tool to check the results.
> Master level - make sure they work even for large files of several gigabytes (i.e. not fitting into memory) - and do it fast enough.
